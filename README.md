# 4.	Meeting the Client’s Expectations
The app successfully allowed the client to either manually or automatically provide their customers with a way to calculate a discount whenever 5 or more items equal to or greater than $200 were nought. This provided a simple way to perform the calculation and to present this information to the client. The app allowed the client to recorrect their choice is a wrong option was chosen and informed them when an error or incorrect option was made. After each calculation, the app allowed the client to restart the process or to close the app. The tests confirm the app’s functionality.
